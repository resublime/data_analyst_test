# Definitions:
# * A _quarter_ is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
# * A _recession_ is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
# * A _recession bottom_ is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
# * A _university town_ is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.
# 
# **Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)
# 
# The following data files are available for this assignment:
# * From the [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for [all homes at a city level](http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/City/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv), ```City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv```, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
# * From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) which has been copy and pasted into the file ```university_towns.txt```.
# * From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file ```gdplev.xls```. For this assignment, only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.

def get_list_of_university_towns():
    '''Returns a DataFrame of towns and the states they are in from the 
    university_towns.txt list. The format of the DataFrame should be:
    DataFrame( [ ["Michigan", "Ann Arbor"], ["Michigan", "Yipsilanti"] ], 
    columns=["State", "RegionName"]  )
    
    The following cleaning needs to be done:

    1. For "State", removing characters from "[" to the end.
    2. For "RegionName", when applicable, removing every character from " (" to the end.
    3. Depending on how you read the data, you may need to remove newline character '\n'. '''
